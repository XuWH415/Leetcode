Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

UPDATE (2017/1/4):
The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.

        d = set(wordDict)
        v = [False] * (len(s) + 1)          # record if s[:i] can be broke by words in dictionary
        v[0] = True
        
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):

                if v[j] and s[j:i] in d:    # s[:i] can be broke if s[:j] can be broke and s[j:i] is in the dictionary
                    v[i] = True
                    break
                
        return v[len(s)]
